# docker-qgis-base



An image which provides an environment in which you can test and make linux builds of QGIS.

This is no longer used by docker-qgis-desktop and docker-qgis-server. Use this image if you want to be able to build QGIS yourself (you need to mount the checked out code for QGIS into the container then build it).

For QGIS Versions 2.x use the v2 recipe folder.
For QGIS Versions 3.x use the v3 recipe folder (coming soon).
